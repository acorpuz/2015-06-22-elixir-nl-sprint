Materials have been developed and adapted by different contributors during the workshop run at CSC, Espoo, Finland on March 16-17, 2015, with the development and instruction of lessons by Aleksandra Pawlik and Francois Michonneau.

#DATA

##NGS Analyses
The data originally came from a RNAseq analyses published in 2014 by Nabholz, B, Sarah, G, Sabot, F, Ruiz, M, Adam, H, Nidelet, S, Ghesquiere, A, Santoni, S, David, J, and Glemin, S: Transcriptome population genomics reveals severe bottleneck and domestication cost in the African rice (*Oryza glaberrima*), *Molecular Ecology*, 23(9): 2210-2227

The original set of sequences was reduced to reads mapping only on 3 selected genes (provided as reference) and added by random reads.

#Lessons
